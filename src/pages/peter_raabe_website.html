        <h1>Peter B. Raabe, PH.D.</h1>
        <h2>A Philosophical Counselling Website</h2>

        <p>A professional, academic website to highlight the work of Peter B. Raabe, PH.D. Peter needed a site that his students, colleagues and peers could reference. The site contains information about the classes he teaches at the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia, Canada. As well as his numerous published books, articles and speaking engagements.</p>

        <p>I created a clean site that was easy to navigate to the many topics with a focus on typography. I ensured the pages would print well if needed.</p>

        <p><em>This is an older site done in tables that I will be updating to responsive and CSS Grid in the next few months.</em></p>

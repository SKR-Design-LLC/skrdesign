        <h1>Peter B. Raabe, PH.D.</h1>
        <h2>A Philosophical Counselling Website</h2>

        <p>A professional, academic website to highlight the work of Peter B. Raabe, PH.D. Peter needed a site that his students, collegues and peers could reference. The site contains information about university classes he teaches, papers and books he has pubished,  and speaking engagements to name a few.</p>

        <p>I created a clean site that was easy to navigation the many topics with a focus on typograghy. I ensured the pages would print well if needed.</p>

        <p><em>This is an older site done in tables that I will be updating to responsive in the next few months.</em></p>

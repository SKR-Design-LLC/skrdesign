        <h1>Black Market Research</h1>
        <h2>Nashville Indie Rock Band</h2>

        <p>The site was built for the band, Black Market Research, to showcase the band's albums and upcoming shows. In October of 2019 I completed the redesign and built of this site to modernize the design and it's code. I wanted to create a simple, minimalist, site design to keep it uncluttered and create an ease of flow between content.</p>

        <p>The original site was built back in 2012 and was my first responsive design project. At the time I read many articles on the subject and used the methods that appealed to me and delivered the best results. I then researched rock music industry websites of all kinds to learn the visual languages of the sites. I designed and built this site with HTML5, CCS3 and responsive design.</p>

        <p>Black Market Research formed in 2009, Black Market Research, an Indie/Alt band headquartered in Nashville, TN. Nick Britt &mdash; singer, songwriter, guitar. I've been the social media manager since it's formation. I now keep the site maintained.</p>

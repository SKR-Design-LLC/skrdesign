        <h2>Indie Rock Band</h2>

        <p>This site was built for the band, Black Market Research to showcase the band's work and upcoming shows. This was my first responsive design project. I read many articles on the subject, mainly from .Net Magazine and used the methods that appealed to me and delivered the best results. I then researched rock music industry websites of all kinds to learn the visual languages of the sites. I designed two website mock ups that would best reflect the band and the client chose. I designed and built this site with HTML5, CCS3 and responsive design. I designed all visual elements of the site including the navigation. JavaScript by Andrew Clover.</p>
        <p>Black Market Research formed in 2009, Black Market Research, an Indie/Alt band headquartered in Nashville, TN. Nick Britt - singer, songwriter, guitar. I've been the publicist for the band since it's formation.</p>

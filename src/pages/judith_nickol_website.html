                    <p>The design came from the crispness of a gallery.  Typography is always important to a design, but on a stark site it's even more important.  The labels were created to look like the information card next to a work in a gallery.</p>

                    <p>A one page website for the artist to display her works, list of galleries representing her, and providing a way for interested collectors to contact her.</p>

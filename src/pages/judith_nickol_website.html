                    <h2>Canadian Artist</h2>

                    <p>A one page website for the artist to display her works, list the galleries she is showing at and provide a way for interested collectors to contact her.</p>

                    <p>The design came from the crispness of a gallery showing. Fonts were an important choice for such a stark white background. The labels were created to look like the information card next to a work in a gallery.</p>

                    <p><em>Launched in 2020.</em><br />

                    <p>The website is a place for the local disc golf club to post information about their annual events, biweekly tags matches and bring attention to the fantastic local courses they access.</p>

                    <p>I wanted the site to be fun and informative.  I designed the website to be easy to navigate on mobile and desktop.  We get a lot of sun in Colorado, and the primary color, sky blue, was representative of this.</p>

                    <p><em>Built in 2020.</em></p>

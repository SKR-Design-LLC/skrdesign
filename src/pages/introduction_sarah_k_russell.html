            <h1>Introduction to the Website Developer &mdash; </h1>
            <h2>Sarah K. Russell</h2>

            <p>I have been building websites and learning for over 16 years. I say, learning, because this wonderful industry is always coming up with new and better ways of building sites. To build sites is to be constantly learning new things and finding how you can best apply them. All the while making sure you give the user the best experience you can. It is the perfect industry for someone always looking for a fun new challenge.</p>

            <p>I fell in love with web development in my last year at the University of Alberta. I needed an extra studio course for my Fine Arts &mdash; Visual Communications Degree and signed up. Before I knew it, I was at the top of my class, it all just made sense to me. I had found a language to love.</p>

        <h3>This Site</h3>
        <p>Growing up in South Carolina there was a small, three room library just down the block from our house. This was before the internet. When I wanted to learn about something, I would run down to the library and dive into all the books I could get my hands on whatever new subject had tickled my fancy. I think this is where I also found a connection with the internet &mdash; the internet is a library anyone can access from anywhere.</p>

        <p>In 2019 this portfolio site has been rebuilt to pay homage to those days in the library surrounded by glorious &mdash; books. Books and websites are very much the same &mdash; a medium for information or telling a story. This sites' format allowed me to focus on the graghic design of the page structure with a emphasis on typograghy.</p>

        <p><em>This responsive site was built with a Foundation base, the homepage is a Flexbox layout while the interior page layout was more suited to CSS Grid.</em></p>

                    <h2>Building Websites for Banking &amp; Financial Institutions</h2>

                    <p>Advanced Web Builder at <a href="https://www.profitstars.com/online-and-mobile/web-solutions/pages/design-and-hosting.aspx">ProfitStars</a> from January 2014 to April 2019. Our department, Web Solutions, provide website design, responsively built websites, hosting, and content management for banking and financial institutions.</p>

                    <p>The designer provided Illustrator files of the site mockups and I built the site in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Foundation or Bootstrap base. When building website I was also responsible for building to ADA standards, SEO optimize, cross browser and device testing. Once tested and completed website are added to a content management system within project timelines.</p>

                    <p><em>The sites shown are the property of the bank.</em></p>

                    <h1>Bert Riggall's Greater Waterton, <br />A Conservation Legacy</h1>
                    <h2>Book</h2>

                    <p>Many members of my family contributed in their own ways to help create this wonderful book about my great grandfathers' life and work in the wilds of Southwest Alberta, Canada. Being the &ldquo;computer&rdquo; person of the family I was able to help in my own way by building a site to showcase the book and the events around it. I was thrilled to attend the book launch where our tiny community hall was filled with the whole town and my family. It was a wonderful celebration of a work completed that was now available for all to enjoy.</p>

                    <p>One of the main aspects of the book are the many gorgeous black and white photographs. I wanted to honor these by making the sites' main colors black, grey, white and allowing a hint of color with the golden brown for contrast.</p>

                    <p>With such a small site, the was no need for navigation, which allowed me to use the whole header for the main focus - the book itself.</p>

                    <p><em>The responsive site was built using Foundation as a base.</em></p>
